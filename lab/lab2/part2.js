# Lab 2, Part 2 â€” Underscore Analyze

## Introduction

Let's revisit the bike share data from Week 2 Lab 1, Part 4. Remember, each array contains the following:

1. lng
2. lat
3. label
4. number of bike share docks at the station

## Task 1

We're especially interested in number 4: number of bike share docks at the station.

Using underscore functions, generate a list of all bike share docks that are greater than 20. One
way to do this is by using _.filter, but you can try other solutions as well. Set your answer to
variable "largeStationList".

Reminder: you can (and should) use `console.log` to test your solutions!

## Task 2

Let's say we only care about the final count of bike share locations with more than 20 docks.
Calculate the value by using _.countBy and set your answer to variable "largeStationCount".

var data = bikeArrayClean;
var obj = function (num) {
  for (i=0; i < data.length; i++)
  return num = data[i][3]
}

var list = function (obj) {
  var obj = data[i][3]
  for (i = 0; i < data.length; i++)
  {if (obj < 20){
    list = data.splice(obj)
  }
  return list
}
}
/*
var largeStationList = _.filter (data, function (num){
  var num = data[3];
  for (i=0; i < data.length; i++){
    return num >20
    }
  return data
})

var largeStationCount = _.countBy (largeStationList, function(num) {
  return num > 20 ? 'yes': 'no';
})
*/

//_.arraysEqual
